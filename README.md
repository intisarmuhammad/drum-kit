# drum-kit🥁🥁🥁
I created a drum kit using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to showcase my advanced JavaScript skills by using click and keyboaard Event Listeners, switch statements, and passing high order functions. I also added animation to the pictures so that when a key is hit or the picture is selected, the corresponding image is highlighted.

The process I liked the most about this project was figuring out how to play sounds n a website by using a function with the play() method.
